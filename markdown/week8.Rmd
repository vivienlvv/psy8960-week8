# 2 **Script Settings and Resources**
[Insert plain text explanation]
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# Loading all required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

setwd("../")

# Add line for knitting to the "out" directory
# knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir=normalizePath('../'))
```



# 3 **Data Import and Cleaning**
For this section, using a single series of pipes, I cleaned the data by reverse coding Q5 (instead of doing it directly on csv file to ensure reproducibility), casted variables into their correct types, and computed the mean of Q1-Q6 as well as mean of Q8-Q10 for creating data visualization below. 
\n
```{r cleaning, message= FALSE}

week8_tbl = read_csv("../data/week3.csv") %>% 
  tibble() %>% 
  mutate(q5 = 6 - q5,
         gender = factor(gender, levels = c("M", "F"), labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         timeStart = ymd_hms(timeStart),
         timeEnd = ymd_hms(timeEnd)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(mean_1_to_6 = mean(c(q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6)),
         mean_8_to_10 = mean(c(q8,q9,q10))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

# 4 **Visualization**
To display data from Q1 to Q6, I enabled paginated view by...
I created a scatterplot using ggplot() and used geom_smooth() to create a regression line, leaving se = TRUE (default) to retain the shaded error band. 

\n
```{r visualizations, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align= "center"}

week8_tbl %>% select(paste0("q",1:6))

# Scatterplot
week8_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_1_to_6, y = mean_8_to_10)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "purple") + 
  labs(x = "Mean scores on Q1-Q6",
       y = "Mean scores on Q8-Q10")
```


# 5 **Analysis** 
The code below computes the correlation between mean of Q1-Q6 and mean of Q8-10. I observed a correlation of `r cor.test(week8_tbl$mean_1_to_6,week8_tbl$mean_8_to_10)$estimate` with a p-value of `r cor.test(week8_tbl$mean_1_to_6,week8_tbl$mean_8_to_10)$p.value` > 0.05. Using the threshold of $\alpha$ = .05, the correlation between the mean of Q1-Q6 and mean of Q8-Q10 are not statistically different from zero. 

\n
```{r analysis}
cor_result = cor.test(x = week8_tbl$mean_1_to_6, y = week8_tbl$mean_8_to_10)
```

# 6 **Data Export** 
In this final step, I exported the cleaned dataset as an RDS object to retain properties (e.g., types) of the dataset and saved it into the data sub-directory. 
```{r export}
week8_tbl %>% saveRDS(file = "../data/week8_shiny_data.RDS")
```
